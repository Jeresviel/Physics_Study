  abstract      = {A geometric view of the possible outcomes of elastic collisions of two massive bodies is developed that integrates laboratory, center of mass, and relative body frames in a single diagram. From these diagrams all the scattering properties of binary collisions can be obtained. The particular case of gravitational scattering by a moving massive object corresponds to the slingshot maneuver, and its maximum velocity is obtained.},

  title         = {Binary Collisions and the Slingshot Effect},
  __markedentry = {[Jeresviel:6]},
  abstract      = {We derive the equations for the gravity assist manoeuvre in the general 2D case without the constraints of circular planetary orbits or widely different masses as assumed by Broucke, and obtain the slingshot conditions and maximum energy gain for arbitrary mass ratios of two colliding rigid bodies. Using the geometric view developed in an earlier paper by the authors the possible trajectories are computed for both attractive or repulsive interactions yielding a further insight on the slingshot mechanics and its parametrization. The general slingshot manoeuvre for arbitrary masses is explained as a particular case of the possible outcomes of attractive or repulsive binary collisions, and the correlation between asymptotic information and orbital parameters is obtained in general.},
